HippoMan - A Scratch Game
Overview
HippoMan is an exciting game developed using Scratch. The game features HippoMan, a flying purple hippo with green wings, who must navigate from one skyscraper to another while avoiding hypnotized parrots sent by the Magic HypnoToad. The objective is to help HippoMan reach the Magic HypnoToad safely to win the game.

Jumping: Press the spacebar (space) to make HippoMan jump to avoid the incoming parrots.
Winning Condition: Successfully reach the Magic HypnoToad without getting hit by any parrots.
Losing Condition: If HippoMan touches a parrot, he will fall off the rope, and the game will end.
Features
Sprites: The game includes multiple sprites, such as HippoMan, Magic HypnoToad, and hypnotized Parrots.
Custom Block: A custom block is used for handling the fall behavior of HippoMan when he touches a parrot.
